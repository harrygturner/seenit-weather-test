This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Coding Challenge

For this coding challenge we would like you to write a simple reactive page that will display a summary of todays weather based on the users location. The location can be obtained however you want. The app must make api calls to a free weather service, e.g. https://openweathermap.org/api.

## Technology

The Site should be built using React. If you want you can add a Node.js back end to handle the api call (This can be in a seperate repo if needed)

## Criteria

We will be looking at
* Code Quality
* Test Strategy
* Reactive design
* Readability of code
* Usage of current good practices
* Use of Javascript built in data structures and methods

Feel free to show us what you can do, at Seenit we love to be impressed.

## Test Submission

* Fork this repo
* Make your changes (We dont expect you to spend a long time on this, hopefully you can get this done in a few hours)
* Send us a link to your repo either directly or through your recruiter
